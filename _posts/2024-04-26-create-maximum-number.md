## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` representing the digits of two numbers and an integer `k`, create the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` from digits of these two numbers while preserving the relative order of the digits from the same array. https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/

## Understanding the Problem
The problem is to merge two arrays into the largest possible number of length `k` using digits from both, while maintaining the order of digits as they appear in their respective arrays. A direct approach might attempt to combine the arrays in every possible way and check which combination yields the largest number, but this is inefficient for larger arrays.

## Dynamic Programming Strategy: The Key to the Solution
The core idea involves:
- **Single Array Max Sequence Generation**: For each array and for each possible sub-length, generate the maximum possible sequence of that length.
- **Merge with Order Preservation**: Merge two sequences to form the largest possible number, respecting the order from both sequences.

## Algorithmic Approach
1. **Max Single Array Function**: A helper function to generate the maximum subsequence of length `k` for an array while preserving the order.
2. **Merge Function**: A function to merge two sequences into the largest possible number.
3. **Main Function**:
   - Iterate over all possible splits between `nums1` and `nums2` that sum to `k`.
   - Use the helper functions to get the best sequence from each part and merge them.
   - Track the largest sequence found.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O((m + n) * k^2)`, because for each split, we compute maximum subsequences and merge them.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, as we are storing sequences up to length `k`.

## Detailed Walkthrough of the Example
**Example Input:**
- `nums1 = [3,4,6,5]`
- `nums2 = [9,1,2,5,8,3]`
- `k = 5`

#### Step 1: Max Single Number Generation
- We need to generate the maximum subsequences for various lengths from each array using the `maxSingleNumber` function.

**From `nums1`**:
- For `k = 1`: The maximum number possible from `[3,4,6,5]` is `[6]`.
- For `k = 2`: The maximum numbers possible are `[6, 5]`.
- For `k = 3`: The maximum numbers possible are `[4, 6, 5]`.
- For `k = 4`: The original sequence itself, `[3, 4, 6, 5]`.

**From `nums2`**:
- For `k = 1`: The maximum number is `[9]`.
- For `k = 2`: The maximum numbers are `[9, 8]`.
- For `k = 3`: The maximum numbers are `[9, 8, 3]` (since `3` is the last digit, it is taken to fill the sequence).
- For `k = 4`: The maximum numbers are `[9, 5, 8, 3]`.
- For `k = 5`: The maximum numbers are `[9, 2, 5, 8, 3]`.

#### Step 2: Merge Function
- This function takes two arrays and merges them into the largest possible sequence, respecting the original order of each but choosing the largest possible leading number at each step.

#### Step 3: Combining Strategies
- For each possible split of the total number `k` into two parts—one from `nums1` and one from `nums2`—we generate maximum numbers and then merge them.

**Combination Scenarios**:
- `i = 0` and `k-i = 5`: Merge `[]` from `nums1` and `[9, 2, 5, 8, 3]` from `nums2`.
- `i = 1` and `k-i = 4`: Merge `[6]` from `nums1` and `[9, 5, 8, 3]` from `nums2`.
- `i = 2` and `k-i = 3`: Merge `[6, 5]` from `nums1` and `[9, 8, 3]` from `nums2`.
- `i = 3` and `k-i = 2`: Merge `[4, 6, 5]` from `nums1` and `[9, 8]` from `nums2`.
- `i = 4` and `k-i = 1`: Merge `[3, 4, 6, 5]` from `nums1` and `[9]` from `nums2`.

### Example Merge Operation:
Let's illustrate one of these merges—`i = 3` and `k-i = 2`:
- **First Number**: Between `[4, 6, 5]` and `[9, 8]`, the largest available first digit is `9`.
- **Second Number**: Now, we compare `[4, 6, 5]` and `[8]`. The next largest available is `8`.
- **Remaining Numbers**: Continue with `[4, 6, 5]`.
- **Resulting Number**: The merged number is `[9, 8, 6, 5, 3]`.

### Final Step: Choosing the Best Combination
- Compare all the results from the different merges, and the final output is the largest sequence obtained, which in this walkthrough, and under correct implementation, would be `[9, 8, 6, 5, 3]`.

### Conclusion
This code efficiently finds the largest possible sequence by using dynamic programming principles and combinatorial strategies, considering all possible distributions of `k` between the two input arrays to find the optimal solution.

## Code Implementation
```javascript
function maxSingleNumber(nums, k) {
    const stack = [];
    let toRemove = nums.length - k;
    for (let num of nums) {
        while (stack.length && toRemove > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] < num) {
            stack.pop();
            toRemove--;
        }
        stack.push(num);
    }
    return stack.slice(0, k);
}

function merge(nums1, nums2) {
    const result = [];
    while (nums1.length > 0 || nums2.length > 0) {
        if (nums1.length === 0) {
            result.push(nums2.shift());
        } else if (nums2.length === 0) {
            result.push(nums1.shift());
        } else if (nums1[0] > nums2[0]) {
            result.push(nums1.shift());
        } else if (nums1[0] < nums2[0]) {
            result.push(nums2.shift());
        } else {
            result.push(nums1 > nums2 ? nums1.shift() : nums2.shift());
        }
    }
    return result;
}

var maxNumber = function(nums1, nums2, k) {
    let maxResult = [];
    for (let i = Math.max(0, k - nums2.length); i <= Math.min(k, nums1.length); i++) {
        const maxNums1 = maxSingleNumber(nums1, i);
        const maxNums2 = maxSingleNumber(nums2, k - i);
        const currentMax = merge(maxNums1, maxNums2);
        if (maxResult < currentMax) {
            maxResult = currentMax;
        }
    }
    return maxResult;
};
